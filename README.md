# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created because as a bootcamp student, I wanted all of my notes to be structured on a webpage so that they are easily accessible. It contains notes on four topics: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript

## Installation

## Usage

To use this study guide, review each section of notes. Each section contains a topic we learned throughout the prework.

Open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). That will open up a panel that will suggest a topic to study first, as well as list all of the topics we learned from the prework
