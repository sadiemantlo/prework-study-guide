        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML elements work together to make the framework of a webpage</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The head element is a container for metadata. Meta elements contain information about the page that is used by the browser</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are known as child elements</li>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
            <li>Inline CSS is used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file by applying a specific HTML tag</li>
            <li>Most popular way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet</li>
            <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules or declerations will apply</li>
            <li>You can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule by using a comma in order to not repeat youself (DRY) code</li>

          <h2>Git</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
            <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
            <li>Always make a feature branch to work in as to maintain the main branch</li>
            <li>The feature branch is where we make commits of all the changes made to the code. Always add a commit message describing what changed in the code</li>

          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
            <li>You can use the "console.log()" method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument in the parentheses</li>
            <li>When using "console.log()", always define the variable first before calling it to be logged to the console</li>
            <li>Check prework module 3.3.4 for more information about conditional statements including the 'if' statement</li>
            <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are used to hold data that is related in some way</li>
            <li>JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. Meaning, the first item in an array has an index of 0, not 1</li>
            <li>A 'for' loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to preform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
            <li>Check prework module 3.3.5 for more information about using a 'for' loop</li>
            <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to preform a certain task</li>
            <li>Functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run, you have to call a function by name in order to execute it</li>
