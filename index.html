          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
            <li>Inline CSS is used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file by applying a specific HTML tag</li>
            <li>Most popular way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet</li>
            <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules or declerations will apply</li>
            <li>You can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule by using a comma in order to not repeat youself (DRY) code</li>
